This is an independent community package for [Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org/specification). It is not an endorsement or an official package from Context7.

- Component: MCP server
- Transport: `stdio`
- Runtime: integrity-locked `@upstash/context7-mcp@4.0.3`; install scripts are disabled
- Requirement: Node.js 22 or newer; the first launch downloads the locked npm closure into plugin data
- Upstream documentation: https://context7.com
- Authentication: No credential is declared by the package. Context7 may apply its own service limits.

Review the server's tools, scopes, and write capabilities before enabling it. Agent Plugins 1.0 standardizes packaging, not permissions or sandboxing.
