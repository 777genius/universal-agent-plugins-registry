# Plugin verification matrix

Updated on 2026-08-10. Each column is independent: a schema pass is not an
install, an auth challenge is not OAuth success, and tool discovery is not a
tool call. `Direct harness` means MCP Inspector, not a client installation.
All passes below are historical. Current stable-launch runtime/OAuth status is
explicitly unavailable until the protected launch workflow completes against
the exact signed production publication and attested `agentplugins-v0.1.18`
release.

Current distribution, release sequence, and digest identity are generated from
[`registry/directory.json`](../registry/directory.json), not copied into this
historical matrix.

The automated Codex record includes the public release ref and commit, workflow
URL and commit, copy-ready reproduction commands, and a sanitized three-event
transcript. All client records are under [`tests/e2e/results`](../tests/e2e/results).

The [Cloudflare Docs ChatGPT record](https://github.com/777genius/universal-agent-plugins/blob/fd77a74fa85724a57b328157ab82ef4dd991cda5/tests/e2e/results/chatgpt-cloudflare-docs-direct-2026-08-10.json)
(revision `fd77a74fa85724a57b328157ab82ef4dd991cda5`, SHA-256
`050a18c56cf3f6b98d12ad35ac3c4642bd18d9e862956447dc3dad8e3189bcc5`)
proves only a direct registered no-auth development connection: `list_resources`
and one read-only search passed. The separate [personal-app record](https://github.com/777genius/universal-agent-plugins/blob/2ddbb99dd190c1792b79904f9875e6322bccd243/tests/e2e/results/chatgpt-cloudflare-docs-personal-app-2026-08-10.json)
(revision `2ddbb99dd190c1792b79904f9875e6322bccd243`, SHA-256
`97ddb41b887eebb7629bff1ae88937448b0c23073688122ab8939c3d96372b37`)
proves Installed discovery under Personal, user-attested manual activation,
exact app ID linkage, and one read-only prompt with exactly two tool calls. It
does not by itself prove local `.codex-plugin` ingestion, repository marketplace
installation, or package-routed runtime. The separate
[desktop-package record](https://github.com/777genius/universal-agent-plugins/blob/fa9d61e1fe49bf3d69f54e451f6320f27930143a/tests/e2e/results/chatgpt-cloudflare-docs-desktop-package-2026-08-10.json)
(revision `fa9d61e1fe49bf3d69f54e451f6320f27930143a`, SHA-256
`85abcc90d50f358eb3d216d73b4dd33dbd6493d39d530070032ae6f50ced9990`)
proves exact-revision marketplace registration, official manager installation,
enabled state, cache materialization, and desktop backend parsing of the app
binding. It does not prove ChatGPT Work UI activation or package-routed runtime.

The historical 15/15 row applies only to its linked revision and catalog
digest. It does not identify today's Directory defaults or package trees.

The three `0.1.6` lifecycle/projection rows come from public run `31363316668` at
main commit [`d3941c0`](https://github.com/777genius/universal-agent-plugins/commit/d3941c0ec097a44123eb9c40df940a3cda2a3406).
They prove source resolution, package validation, transactional lifecycle,
catalog-v2 ChatGPT package preparation, and native Copilot lifecycle. They do
not prove ChatGPT Work activation, package-routed runtime, Copilot tool runtime,
or OAuth; those claims stay separate. Sanitized Actions evidence artifacts are
retained for 30 days on the linked run.

The Figma record is a separate sanitized interactive Codex check. It does not
claim Figma installation, OAuth, or runtime in ChatGPT, Cursor, Kiro, or Copilot.
