This package is independently assembled by 777genius from configuration anchored to ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp at commit `774d78f5eef5e610407a0c92fa6ec5ed74b027e8`. It is not authored, published, or endorsed by ChromeDevTools or Google.

- Component: MCP server
- Transport: `stdio`
- Runtime: integrity-locked `chrome-devtools-mcp@1.7.0`; install scripts are disabled
- Requirement: Node.js 22 or newer; the first launch downloads the locked npm closure into plugin data
- Privacy: upstream usage statistics are disabled by default with `--no-usage-statistics`
- Upstream source: https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp
- Authentication: No service credential is declared; the launched browser controls its own session.

Review the server's tools, scopes, and write capabilities before enabling it. Agent Plugins 1.0 standardizes packaging, not permissions or sandboxing.
